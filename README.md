# Analyzing Global Temperatures

Purpose: This is the first project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Course, Explore Weather Trends, that analyzes local temperature trends to overall global temperature trends.

Introduction: Data was generated from the SQL workspace in Udacity course pages and was filtered by city and average temperatures. The two required files queried were city_data.csv and global_data.csv by way of Udacity Query application.

Data is actual temperature, not anomaly values.
